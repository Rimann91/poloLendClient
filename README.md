# PoloLendClient

This is a simple asyncronous desktop client for managing your poloniex lending
It is built with Python3.5 and the tkinter gui framework. 

**Current Issues:**

Private calls to poloniex api are not asyncronous. Having trouble sending API keys so I am currently using a third party syncronous wrapper for private calls.

This is still a work in progress and a lot of functionality is missing
